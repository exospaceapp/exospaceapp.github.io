            <p class="p-styles">
                In the vast expanse of the cosmos, a unique event unfolded. A modest passenger from Earth, a bacterium, 
                has embarked on an interstellar journey. This bacteria is the same species found on the Tanpopo mission 
                which is an orbital astrobiology experiment investigating the potential interplanetary transfer of life, 
                organic compounds, and possible terrestrial particles in the low Earth orbit, an ambitious project 
                studying the possibility of life's existence beyond our home planet. The mission is designed to test the 
                panspermia hypothesis – the idea that life can be transferred from one planet to another by rocky debris. 
                Carried by cosmic winds, the bacteria found its way to a 
                distant planet located 1.2 Astronomical Units from its star.

                
 
            </p>

            <p class="p-styles">
                This planet was unlike any other. It had a gravitational force of 8 g/m<sup>2</sup> and a mass of 0.98 Earth masses. 
                Because the planet was 1.2 AU from its star that caused the planet to have a temperature that ranged from 60°F to 75°F (15°C to 24°C), 
                conditions that were just right for life as we know it, specifically when it comes to fungi as they like dark and moisture. A wise man once said,
                 “Life, after all, finds a way to survive” That’s right! Rare types of fungi are thriving even on the walls of collapsed nuclear reactors that 
                 still emit radiation. Even in places where it seems unlikely that anything could survive, such as the bubbling hot springs in Yellowstone or
                  the sterile chambers where germs were removed to the utmost for assembling space probes, some form of life still manages to survive. 
                  They even breed vigorously in places you wouldn’t expect.
            </p>

            <p class="p-styles">
                 The bacteria landed near a serene lake, which encouraged the growth of fungi. In this new world, under the gentle warmth of its star 
                and nourished by the planet's waters, the mushrooms began to grow. They thrived in this environment, growing larger than their Earth 
                counterparts due to the planet's lower gravity. As time passed, the mushrooms spread across the planet, creating a landscape dotted 
                with their distinctive forms. The planet earned a new name - the Exotopia Planet. Which comes from the words Exoplanet and Utopia-an 
                imagined place or state of things in which everything is perfect as this planet has the perfect conditions for mushrooms to grow this tall.

            </p>

            <p class="p-styles">
                But the mushrooms were not alone. In this fertile environment, new creatures began to emerge. The emergence of life on this planet 
                could be similar to how life started on Earth. Scientists believe that life may have originated from simple organic compounds that
                 gradually formed more complex molecules. Over time, these molecules could have evolved into primitive life forms, which then diversified 
                 into a wide variety of creatures. This is the story of how life began on the Exotopia Planet - a testament to the resilience of life and 
                 its ability to flourish in the cosmos.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;line-height: 1.3rem;">A sporoid is a spore-like creature that can travel through the air and colonize new habitats. 
                        It has a spherical shape and a thin membrane that allows it to float. It can sense radiation and move toward it by using flagella-like structures. It can also produce toxins and enzymes that help it break down organic matter and infect other creatures. Sporoids are parasitic and can take over the bodies of their hosts, turning them into zombie-like creatures.</p>
